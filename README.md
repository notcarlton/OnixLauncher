**The most recent and modern launcher for Onix Client.**

## Contributing
If there is an issue open with your fix or addition to the launcher, please close it with your pull request. Here are some [good first issues](https://github.com/notcarlton/OnixLauncher/labels/good%20first%20issue) to get you started.

Make sure you follow the [naming convention](https://github.com/notcarlton/OnixLauncher/blob/main/NAMING.md) I've set for the project.

## Open source
What you CAN do:
- Modify the launcher for personal use
- Fork the launcher and add some cool features, **without** Onix Client branding
- Submit a pull request with your own additions to the launcher

What you CAN'T do:
- Sell the launcher, even if it's modified
- Modify the launcher and distribute it without credit (no skidding)
- Completely ruin the launcher's design, because I like my design

**We cannot ensure that all forks of the launcher are safe. If a fork does anything dangerous, it's not our problem.**
